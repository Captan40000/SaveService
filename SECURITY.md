## Supported Versions

All versions currently being backed with Back-end updates, or just general updates. If your using a deprecated version, then I suggest using a usable version or the most up-to-date version.

| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1   | :x: |
| 0.2   | :white_check_mark:                |
| nil   | :x: |
| nil   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a issue(s), please foward it to #issues, as I will check it more often then anywhere else. If it's critical, you may PM me on the DeveloperForums.
